            <p>Each of the members of the Olsen family will have the sacred responsibility of creating a culinary masterpeice on their designated night each week. If an individual does not feel up to the task of creating culinary masterpieces, they will need to build a bridge and get over it. These are the rules, and there are no exceptions... Except of course when there are. These times are to be appoved by a parental party. </p>
            <p>Eating at an extablishment other than the Olsen residence is strictly to be determined by the parental parties of the Olsen residence. In order to select from the many eating establishments available, the two parental parties may council together and/or resort to the age old practice of ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.</p>
